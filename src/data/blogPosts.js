      <p>I start a lot of things.</p>

      <p>Not on purpose. It just happens. I’ll be working on one thing and suddenly get the urge to start something else. Music, code, an idea for a new app — whatever pulls me in. Most days I’ve got three or four things open, half-finished, all buzzing in the background.</p>

      <p>It used to stress me out. I’d look around and see people staying focused, finishing projects, moving in a straight line. Meanwhile, I was hopping between ideas, leaving things undone, second-guessing if I was even making progress.</p>

      <p>But I’ve noticed something. Even when I don’t finish something, I still get something out of it. A new idea, newfound knowledge, or just a little spark I might come back to later. And sometimes, I do come back. Not always, but enough.</p>

      <p>It’s not the cleanest process. Definitely not the most efficient. But it’s real. It’s how my creativity works right now, and maybe that’s okay.</p>

      <p>I don’t have a perfect system. Still figuring it out. Still forgetting things. Still jumping between tabs. But I’m learning to pay attention to what keeps pulling me in.</p>

      <p>That part feels important.</p>
